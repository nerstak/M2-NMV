# M2-NMV
Practical work related to "Noyaux Multi-c≈ìurs et Virtualisation" (Multi-core kernels and virtualization) at Sorbonne University.

Note that I've chosen this course as an opening lesson: I am not an expert in kernels. There might be (and there are) issues and bugs. One of the issue I've had while completing this TP was the lack of official answers, so I'm hoping it might help other understand.

The TP3 is not present as it was not mandatory and I did not have the time to complete it given the difficulty.
